Whenever you create a Pull Request (PR), a maintainer will self-assign
themselves as the *upstream*. The upstream decides if your PR is accepted and
might require you to amend additional changes before merging. You can expect
the upstream to communicate clearly if there are any issues preventing your PR
from being merged, and how they can be fixed. Once merged, the upstream will
add the `merged` label to your PR.

You are also welcome to submit PRs you would like to receive feedback on, but
which are not ready to be merged: include the labels `[wip]` in the title of
PRs that require further work, and `[sketch]` for PRs that are not meant to be
merged at all.

Our [Documentation Guide](https://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch/blob/master/src/doc/documentation-guide.md)
gives pointers on how to contribute to the project's documentation.

If you wish to record a copyright notice with your contribution then you can
optionally do this in the file `src/COPYRIGHT`; copyright notices in other
files will be rejected.
