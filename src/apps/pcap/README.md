# PcapReader and PcapWriter Apps (apps.pcap.pcap)

The `PcapReader` and `PcapWriter` apps can be used to inject and log raw
packet data into and out of the app network using the
[Libpcap File Format](http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat/).
`PcapReader`reads raw packets from a PCAP file and transmits them on its
`output` port while `PcapWriter` writes packets received on its `input`
port to a PCAP file.

configuration arguments to read from and write to respectively.
