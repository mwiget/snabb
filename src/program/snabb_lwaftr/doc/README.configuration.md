# Snabb-lwaftr configuration

Snabb-lwaftr alpha is configured by a text file.

```bash
$ cat sample.conf
aftr_ipv4_ip = 10.10.10.10
aftr_ipv6_ip = 8:9:a:b:c:d:e:f
aftr_mac_b4_side = 22:22:22:22:22:22
aftr_mac_inet_side = 12:12:12:12:12:12
b4_mac = 44:44:44:44:44:44
binding_table = path/to/binding.table
hairpinning = true
icmpv6_rate_limiter_n_packets=3e5
icmpv6_rate_limiter_n_seconds=4
inet_mac = 68:68:68:68:68:68
ipv4_mtu = 1460
ipv6_mtu = 1500
policy_icmpv4_incoming = ALLOW
policy_icmpv6_incoming = ALLOW
policy_icmpv4_outgoing = ALLOW
policy_icmpv6_outgoing = ALLOW
v4_vlan_tag = 1234
v6_vlan_tag = 42
vlan_tagging = true
```

The lwaftr is associated with two physical network cards. One of these cards
faces the internet; traffic over it is IPv4. The other faces the IPv6-only
internal network, and communicates primarily with B4s.

## Line-by-line explanation

First, the IP and MAC addresses for both interfaces are set:

```lua
aftr_ipv4_ip = 10.10.10.10
aftr_ipv6_ip = 8:9:a:b:c:d:e:f
aftr_mac_b4_side = 22:22:22:22:22:22
aftr_mac_inet_side = 12:12:12:12:12:12
```

This associates **12:12:12:12:12:12** and **10.10.10.10** with the
internet-facing NIC, and **8:9:a:b:c:d:e:f** and **22:22:22:22:22:22** with the
NIC facing the internal network.

As this software is alpha and built on a kernel bypass basis, it does not have
support for [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) or
[NDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbor_Discovery_Protocol). It assumes that
it will talk directly to only one host on each side, and specifies their MAC
addresses for the outgoing packets.

```lua
b4_mac = 44:44:44:44:44:44
inet_mac = 68:68:68:68:68:68
```

The alpha lwaftr can talk to any host, but assumes that the above ones are the
next hop.

```lua
binding_table = path/to/binding.table,
```

See [README.bindingtable.md](README.bindingtable.md) for binding table details.

```lua
hairpinning = true,
```

Configurable hairpinning is a requirement of [RFC 7596](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7596);
it can be true or false.

```lua
icmpv6_rate_limiter_n_packets=3e5,
icmpv6_rate_limiter_n_seconds=4,
```

ICMPv6 rate limiting is mandated by several RFCs. This example says that the
lwaftr can send at most 300,000 (3 * 10^5) ICMPv6 packets per 4 seconds.
Lower values are recommended for non-experimental use.

```lua
ipv4_mtu = 1460,
ipv6_mtu = 1500,
```

The MTU settings are used to determine whether a packet needs to be fragmented.
The current MTU handling is otherwise underdeveloped. It is not dynamically
updated on receiving ICMP packet too big messages.

```lua
policy_icmpv4_incoming = ALLOW,
policy_icmpv6_incoming = ALLOW,
policy_icmpv4_outgoing = ALLOW,
policy_icmpv6_outgoing = ALLOW,
```

Snabb-lwaftr can be configured to ALLOW or DROP incoming and outgoing ICMPv4
and ICMPv6 messages. If a finer granularity of control is desired, contact the
development team via github or email.

```lua
v4_vlan_tag = 1234,
v6_vlan_tag = 42,
vlan_tagging = true
```

Enable/disable 802.1Q Ethernet tagging with 'vlan_tagging'.

If it is enabled, set one tag per interface to tag outgoing packets with, and
assume that incoming packets are tagged. If it is 'false', v4_vlan_tag and
v6_vlan_tag are currently optional (and unused).

Values of `v4_vlan_tag` and `v6_vlan_tag` represent the identifier value in a
VLAN tag. It must be a value between 0 and 4095.

More sophisticated support, including for mixes of tagged/untagged packets,
will be provided upon request.
