Validate and compile an address map.  An address map defines the set of
IPv4 addresses that are provisioned by an lwAFTR.  It also defines the
way in which those addresses are shared, by specifying the "psid_length"
and "shift" parameters for each address.  See RFC 7597 for more details
on the PSID scheme for how to share IPv4 addresses.

Grammatically, an address map is composed of a list of entries, each of
which specifying a set of IPv4 address and the PSID parameters.
Newlines and other white space are insignificant.  For example:

  1.2.3.4 { psid_length=10 }
  5.6.7.8 { psid_length=5, shift=11 }
  ...

An entry's "psid_length" and "shift" parameters must necessarily add up
to 16, so it is sufficient to specify just one of them.  If neither are
specified, they default to 0 and 16, respectively.

The addresses may be specified as ranges or lists of ranges as well:

  1.2.3.4 { psid_length=10 }
  2.0.0.0, 3.0.0.0, 4.0.0.0-4.1.2.3 { psid_length=7 }

The set of IPv4 address ranges specified in an address map must be
disjoint.

This command will atomically overwrite the output file.  If the output
file name ADDRESSES.MAP is not given as an argument, the output file
will be the name of the input file, minus a ".txt" suffix if present,
plus a ".map" suffix.
