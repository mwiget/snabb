Usage: l2vpn [OPTION]... CONFIG

Provision an endpoint for a Ethernet point-to-point or multipoint VPN
according to the configuration supplied in the CONFIG file.

  -D TIME,   --duration TIME Time in seconds for which the application will
                             be run.  If TIME is equal to 0, the application
                             will run indefinitly or until it is interrupted
  -r,        --reconfig      Enable detection of changes to the configuration.
                             If set, TIME must be > 0 and specifies the interval
                             at which the status of CONFIG is checked.  If the file
                             has been modified, the new configuration is instantiated
                             before the the engine is restarted.  In this mode,
                             the program runs indefinitely. Currently,
                             reconfiguration is rather disruptive.
  -l FILE,   --logfile FILE  Set FILE as the default destination for all
                             output of the Snabb logging facility
  -d,        --debug         Enable additional debugging checks.
  -j CMD,    --jit CMD       Control LuaJIT behavior. Available commands:
                               -jv=FILE, --jit v=FILE
                                 Write verbose JIT trace output to FILE.
                               -jdump=OPTS[,FILE] --jit dump=OPTS[,FILE]
                                 Output JIT traces, optionally to a file.
                               -jp=OPTS[,FILE] --jit p=OPTS[,FILE]
                                 Profile execution with low-overhead sampling.
                               -jopt=OPT
                                 Sets JIT option OPT.
